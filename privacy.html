<p>Home Slide is an application provided as-is by Baptiste Candellier.</p>
<p>
    By choosing to use Home Slide, you agree to the collection and use of
    information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information collected
    is used for providing and improving Home Slide. This information will NOT be
    used or shared with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2 id="information-collection-and-use">Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p>
    The information requested during the usage of Home Slide will be retained on
    your device and is not collected by us, except for the logging purposes
    described below.
</p>
<p>
    The app does use third party services that may collect information used to
    identify you:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Play Services</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/">Firebase Crashlytics</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="error-reporting">Error Reporting</h2>
<p>
    In case an error occurs while using Home Slide, a log event may be sent back
    to us as a way to fix problems and improve the service. This log event may
    include information, such as your device’s IP address, device name,
    operating system version, the configuration of the app, the time and date of
    your use of Home Slide, and other statistics. This information may also
    include entity identifiers (as defined in your Home Assistant instance), or
    device properties, if they are relevant to reproducing the error.
</p>
<p>
    Reporting these error events can be disabled on Home Slide’s settings page.
</p>
<h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>
<p>Home Slide does not make use of cookies or other unique identifiers.</p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>
    Home Slide will never report data to a third-party service without a secure
    TLS connection.
</p>
<p>
    However, the user is free to connect Home Slide to a Home Assistant instance
    using an unsecured (“plain-HTTP”) connection. By so doing, the user
    acknowledges that a third-party might snoop on their connection and collect
    personal information without the user’s knowledge. Thus it is strongly
    suggested that the user only ever setup Home Slide using a secure TLS
    connection to their instance.
