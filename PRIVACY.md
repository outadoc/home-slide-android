# Home Slide Privacy Policy
### Version 2020-09-28

Home Slide is an application provided as-is by Baptiste Candellier.

By choosing to use Home Slide, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information collected is used for providing and improving Home Slide. This information will NOT be used or shared with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

The information requested during the usage of Home Slide will be retained on your device and is not collected by us, except for the logging purposes described below.

The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you:

*   [Google Play Services](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)
*   [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/)

## Error Reporting

In case an error occurs while using Home Slide, a log event may be sent back to us as a way to fix problems and improve the service. This log event may include information, such as your device's IP address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app, the time and date of your use of Home Slide, and other statistics. This information may also include entity identifiers (as defined in your Home Assistant instance), or device properties, if they are relevant to reproducing the error.

Reporting these error events can be disabled on Home Slide's settings page.

## Cookies

Home Slide does not make use of cookies or other unique identifiers.

## Security

Home Slide will never report data to a third-party service without a secure TLS connection.

However, the user is free to connect Home Slide to a Home Assistant instance using an unsecured ("plain-HTTP") connection. By so doing, the user acknowledges that a third-party might snoop on their connection and collect personal information without the user's knowledge. Thus it is strongly suggested that the user only ever setup Home Slide using a secure TLS connection to their instance.
